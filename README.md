# Advent of Code 2017

This repository contains resulting codes for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenge. I have personally chosen JavaScript to solve the challenges as I was learning the language.

## How it works

Each day a specific task (puzzle) is given, with an unique input to each user. The user has to create a program that solves the puzzle with the given input. The solution is the output of the program.

The repository contains a plain HTML file and each solution is printed into the browser console.
